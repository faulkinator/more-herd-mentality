# Contributing to More Herd Mentality

This is a very casual side project, so this is intentionally kept short. 

## Contribute

### Code

To contribute to **code**:

1. Either choose an [issue](https://github.com/faulkinator/more-herd-mentality/issues) or fix a bug that you have found
2. Fork the repo
3. Make your changes
4. Make a pull request detailing your solution

### Questions

The more **new questions**, the better. Use the same steps as the code above, noting that:

- This is a family friendly app, so no adult questions
- Like the original questions in the game, pop culture may be used for questions but please limit to a sensible amount.
  - Some pop-culture references alienate players - so a handful are fine but no more.
- In general, submit questions in the spirit of the original game
- Questions are to be in UK English
- You are most welcome to submit batches of questions in one go
